ruby-agi
========

A fork of Mohammad Khan's ruby-agi library, version 2.0.

This is a fork of the original ruby-agi version 2.0.0 code, which is located @ rubyforge.  
The reason for this fork is that this library throws errors on our Linux setup.  Aside from that, this library functions the same way.

Original notes still located below. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This library comes with absolutely no warranty.

ruby-agi is a library to write AGI scripts in ruby language for Asterisk. ruby-agi does not depend of Asterisk Manager.
There have a very simple AGI script in example/call_log.rb.
I couldn't write any tutorial for ruby-agi and I am not good at it, if anybody want to give me a hand on writing documentation and tutorial, would be greatly appreciated.
